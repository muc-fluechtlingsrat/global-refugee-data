# OECD data
OECD data is focused on its members - high/upper-middle income countries.

Start here: https://data.oecd.org/

## Filterable CSVs

Example: https://data.oecd.org/tax/tax-revenue.htm

Go to the page of the category of interest, then select the year(s) of interest. Click the "download" button and select "selected data only (.csv)" to download a CSV of the filtered data.

## API

https://data.oecd.org/api/sdmx-json-documentation/

## Statistics databases

http://stats.oecd.org/

Has data for both OECD members and other countries by region for some categories.

Tree menu on left side of screen. Results exportable as CSV and other formats.

Of particular interest - International Migration Database: http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIG

Choose the "Variable" dropdown, and then "Inflow of asylum seekers by nationality" (should be named "by receiving nation," because it refers to where they are going, not where they are from). Only goes through 2015.
